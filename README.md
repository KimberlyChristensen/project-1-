## Our project will examine trends in energy generation sources by state from 2001 to 2020, with a focus on any shifts from nonrenewable to renewable energy sources. We will look at changes in fuel source over the 20 year period; megawatt hours by fuel source at the state level; and seeing if there is any statistically significant change in air pollution levels in states that shift to more renewables in that time period.
